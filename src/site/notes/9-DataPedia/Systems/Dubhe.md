3135 - Dubhe, once known as Alpha Ursae Majoris, is a binary system blessed by an inhabitable world. Dubhe revolves around the outer star, a pale yellow sun that orbits a cooler orange giant once every forty-four Terran years. The orbit of Dubhe is elongated as it passes between the binary suns, these periods produces warmer-than-average summers for a world that is overall quite cool with harsh winters. As a result, every two decades Dubhe's polar caps begin a period of rapid melting that causes ocean levels worldwide rise by as much as one or two meters and wide-scale flooding. The intensity of the "super-summer" seasons and the melting of the polar caps has increased over the centuries. This has been attributed to the effects of centuries of mining and industrialization rather than to the planet's subtly growing distance from its primary sun in favor of the secondary.

The first colonists of Dubhe were drawn by the abundance of minerals and arable land, and placed many of their settlements on the coastal regions of the planet's single, equatorial landmass, Holidius. These early settlements were lost to the flooding damage during the "super-summer" seasons. Since then, most of Dubhe‘s large population centers have been moved to higher elevations well inland.

During the Star League era, Dubhe was a border world jointly administered by the Terran Hegemony and the Free World League, and was easily absorbed by the Free World League after the collapse of the Star League. Dubhe suffered from heavy raiding and the occasional planetary invasion, which demolished much of its local industry. During the Word of Blake Jihad, mercenaries employed by the Word of Blake assaulted Dubhe, nearly leveling the capital city of Greenwich in a battle with local militia forces. After being ceded to the Republic of the Sphere, Greenwich was rebuilt, and many of the decimated mining and manufacturing centers have been restored.
