Cloaked in extensive natural resources, Ingress was one of the first worlds colonized during the initial interstellar exodus from Terra. Clustered in towns around the planet‘s single, large ocean, settlers established some light industry near their capital of Askar, but agricultural products quickly became the world‘s dominant export. Self-sufficient from the beginning, Ingress was also one of the first worlds to seek independence from the Terran Alliance, and its well-equipped infantry fought many years before succumbing to the Terran Hegemony.

After the fall of the First Star League, the Capellan Confederation claimed Ingress. Ingress was temporarily made part of the Tikonov Free Republic during the Fourth Succession War, until the Federated Commonwealth absorbed the Republic at the conclusion of the conflict.

In the events leading up to the Federated Commonwealth Civil War, Ingress became one of many worlds abandoned by the Great Houses in the so-called Chaos March. The neighboring planet of Small World quickly proposed an alliance, at gunpoint, with resource-rich Ingress. However, a few years later, the population of Ingress once again fought for and won its independence, at great cost to its infantry legions.

Ingress‘s temporary military weakness made it an easy target during the Blakist Holy War. The Blakists established enormous reeducation camps on the planet, disrupting agriculture and starving over a billion people to death. Ingress‘s economy fully recovered during the Golden Age of Peace, but its population still stands at less than half of its former levels.
