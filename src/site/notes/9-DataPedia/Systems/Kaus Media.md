Kaus Media is a pleasant, terrestrial world with wide, deep oceans, expansive forests and jungles, and varied—yet normally mild—seasons. Yet, for all its natural splendor, the first colonists to explore and exploit this world quickly realized that the lack of easily reached indigenous metals and minerals would doom all efforts to develop their new home. In the search for a source for raw materials to fuel their industry, traders from Kaus Media quickly discovered that their nearest neighbor, Kaus Australis, suffered from the opposite plight, surrounded by abundant and valuable raw materials, but lacking in food and water. A trade deal blossomed into a full-fledged alliance that carried the two worlds through the Age of War and continued even with the ascendance of the Draconis Combine. Efforts by the Lyran Commonwealth to turn this alliance against the Dragon proved disastrous for the so-called ―Kaus alliance worlds during the First Succession War, when the enraged forces of the DCMS bombarded DeGuilles, the planetary capital city—and with it, the governing buildings that served both worlds. Only after surrendering the Lyran instigators and rebel leaders, and agreeing to stiff reparations and an oath of fealty, did the Kaus alliance avoid further destruction, but the entire crisis underscored the strengths and weaknesses of the symbiotic relationship now shared by these twin worlds.

Trade between both resumed again decades after the crisis, though government was less centralized, with each tending to its own affairs from its own respective capitals. Still, in memory of the broken bond, the people of Kaus Media never built over the ruins of DeGuilles. Instead, the new planetary capital, Vanguard City, located just forty kilometers to the north on the continent of Emparos, governs the affairs of this world, and maintains a diplomatic office for the benefit of its neighbor. Several major trading companies that do business under exclusive license with both Kaus planets also call Vanguard City their home, thanks to the presence of the planet‘s largest spaceport. Aside from Emparos, Kaus Media‘s other four major continents are Romana, Hyadamos, Gaul, and Normano. All but Gaul, the planet‘s frozen south polar continent, are populated with various small and medium-sized commercial and rural towns scattered along the shores of various rivers and lakes.
