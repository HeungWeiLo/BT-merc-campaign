3135 - Zavijava is an extremely volcanic world, so much so that high quantities of sulfur gas and other particulate matter blown into the atmosphere by constant eruptions have rendered the air difficult to breathe without filter masks, and prompted an ongoing exodus from the planet. The eruptions began rather suddenly in the twenty-fifth century, long after the first settlers made planetfall on this otherwise unremarkable but heretofore terrestrial world. Since then, the rate of eruptions has risen steadily through the years, to the point where no less than seven active volcanic chains spew lava and ash on a weekly basis. The cause for Zavijava‘s geological woes has never been adequately explained, and even stymied the Terran Hegemony‘s experts during the Star League era, but the effects have been dramatic indeed. In almost six hundred years, the worldwide environment changed so radically that most of the native animal species have gone extinct and temperatures worldwide have dropped nearly ten degrees due to the “nuclear winter” effects of so much ash blown into the sky. The planetary population, once numbering almost three billion, has also dropped steadily as the disturbances continue, but enough hearty souls and mining corporations have remained behind to try to make the most of the situation. Adding to the declining state of this world, of course, has been its history during the Succession Wars. As a Lyran-Free Worlds border planet, Zavijava has naturally been the target of countless raids and military campaigns in the centuries since the fall of the Star League. Like many other worlds in the region, it also suffered during the Lyran-Skye conflicts that erupted during the Jihad. In the most devastating of these strikes, renegade Marik troops assaulted the planetary spaceport near the capital city of Tzion. The resulting firefight left the capital in flames and cost the lives of over five thousand warriors and civilians. Unlike its neighbors, Zavijava did not receive reconstruction assistance after the world was ceded to The Republic, owing to the ongoing departure of its inhabitants due to the planet‘s natural crisis. Instead, a new spaceport was constructed near the city of Noé, on the northern continent of Peninah, which was also designated as the new administrative capital of Zavijava. The ruins of Tzion, now cleared away, stood on the southern continent, Velvel. In their place now stands a memorial to the fallen on both sides of the Jihad.
