Pandora is a vibrant world with a rich native ecosystem and stunning natural beauty. The planet was originally colonized by people eager to reconnect with nature. Unfortunately the comfortable planet attracted more settlers that had other ideas and the planet quickly became more developed. The industrial development attracted unwanted outside attention and the planet saw quite a bit of warfare in its early history until some peace was restored when the planet was annexed by the Lyran Commonwealth.

Economic incentives and martial law restored order and prosperity to the war-torn planet and helped transform the planet into an industrial powerhouse. Pandora is home to Red Devils Industries as well as the Quickscell Comapny. Red Devils Industries creates several iconic ‘Mechs, such as the Rifleman and BattleMaster at their Pandora facility, as well as iconic combat vehicles like the Pegasus and Condor hovercraft. Quickscell is best known for their combat vehicles, and equally infamous for the poor quality of the same vehicles. The Quickscell plant on Pandora produces staple combat vehicles such as LRM and SRM Carriers, Scorpion Light Tank, and APCs, among many other combat vehicles in common use throughout the Inner Sphere.

Pandora has four continents, Echo, Kaos, Limbo, and Nirvana, all of which ring the planet’s equator. Kaos is the largest of the four continents and is also the most inhabited and is home of the planetary capital Defiance and Red Devils Industries and Quickscell Company. Limbo is the second largest continent and still bears scars from the Age of War, the Star League made progress to repair the damage but the collapse of the League and the Succession Wars and the loss of the terraforming technology stopped all progress. The final two continents, Echo and Nirvana, are primarily rural  and produce enough food to feed the rest of the planet, both continents also have light industry which makes them mostly self sufficient.

Pandora is also home of the Pandora College of Military Sciences.
