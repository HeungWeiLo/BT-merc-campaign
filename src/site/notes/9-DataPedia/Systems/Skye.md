3135 - A rare, habitable planet in a binary star system, Skye‘s single, pan-hemispheric supercontinent of New Scotland boasts cool climates in the northern and southern reaches, coupled with moody rain, fog-wreathed hills, and deep green valleys. These features, more than the vast mineral and metallurgical wealth buried beneath, drew the first settlers, most of whom hailed from Terra‘s British Isles, to this world. These first Scottish and Irish colonists flocked to Skye to recreate the splendors of their native lands, making a fresh start on a world unspoiled by mankind‘s rampant industrialization, and they enacted strict “zoning laws” to limit commercial development and heavy industry. Mining, refining, and manufacturing were restricted to less than fifty percent of the world‘s land area, but despite this severe limitation, which left vast resources untapped by default, these laws did not impede the growth of industry and trade on Skye. A side effect of this arrangement, however, was that exploitable lands were swiftly gobbled up by the wealthiest people and corporations, locking up these resources and giving rise to a nobility that became locked in a geopolitical stasis for centuries. Ian McQuiston, entrepreneur and founder of Skye Traders, was the most powerful of Skye‘s original ruling class, whose economic empire extended to encompass many of the surrounding worlds. Under his guidance and rule, Skye rose to prominence quickly on the galactic scene, ultimately forming the Federation of Skye.

The prosperity and influence of this Federation, which included some of the most heavily developed worlds in the region, fostered a sense of pride that remained strong even after joining with the Tamar Pact and Protectorate of Donegal to create the Lyran Commonwealth. That sense of pride, along with intense love of the world, made Skye the heart and soul of its Federation, and an example to the rest of the Commonwealth. By the time of the Star League, Skye was in its glory as a commercial and industrial hub for the Lyran state, a source for everything from raw materials and native produce to civilian and military aerospace craft and DropShips. Sanglamore Academy, one of the few Star League military schools built outside the Terran Hegemony‘s borders, was established on Skye, and the Shipil Company produced aerospace vehicles from fighters to WarShips for the armies of both the League and the Commonwealth.

In the centuries after the Star League‘s collapse, Skye‘s fortunes gradually began to decline, though the pride of her people remained ever strong. A heavy assault from the Draconis Combine came in 2895, failing to capture the planet but inflicting heavy damage—including a nuclear strike near the eastern city of Inverness—before the invaders were routed after a defeat in the Bannockburn Bogs outside the capital city of New Glasgow. Raids and assaults on the Shipil shipyards over the centuries, and on the Cyclops, Incorporated, armored vehicle facilities, reduced the planet‘s greatest military industries to a fraction of their former glory. Perhaps the most damaging upheavals for Skye over the centuries were the waxing and waning calls for rebellion by her own people against the rule of House Steiner. Numerous attempts were made to break free of Lyran authority, especially after the formation of the short-lived Federated Commonwealth, with the last bid made amid the chaos of the FedCom Civil War.

During the Jihad, Skye suffered from orbital strikes by apparent Free Worlds League troops, prompting counterattacks all along the Federation/League border. When the Blakists themselves invaded Skye later in the war, and Clan Wolf arrived to assist the local defenders in beating them back, Skye‘s remaining military industries and many civilian ventures were leveled. The damage in the fighting devastated the planet‘s infrastructure, mauled much of her virgin landscape, and left countless dead. Though bloodied and battered, Skye recovered, but only through aid from the Lyran state and Devlin Stone‘s Republic of the Sphere. Today, Skye is a member of The Republic, having finally achieved her dream of independence from Lyran rule only to join another realm. Though many native to Skye chafe under this new banner, the old “Free Skye” fever has been muted by an influx of new inhabitants, resettled through Devlin Stone‘s directives to rebuild the wounded planet. Still, the traditional rebelliousness of the people of Skye shows through.

New Glascow remains the planetary capital, but the Prefecture capital city is actually New London, three hundred kilometers south and overlooking the Thames Bay. Cyclops Incorporated creates a wide variety of hover combat vehicles and is located in the city of New Aberdeen, the city is surrounded by rolling hills. Shipil Company is located in the rainy coastal city of Edinburgh and produces DropShips and assault small craft. Skye Pleasure Craft is located in the mild coastal town of Dublin Heights and creates a number of bluewater craft, including military ships. The Sanglamore Academy is located in the city of Bannockburn, which is in the wetlands of New Scotland.
