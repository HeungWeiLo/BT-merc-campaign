Kathil was originally a poor agriculture world, however it has grown into one of the Star League’s key manufacturing planets and after the fall of the League it became one of the most important planets in the Federated Suns. The rise in importance of Kathil during the Star League was due to heavy industrial build up, including the McKenna Shipyards which were built in 2602 and soon after General Motors established its largest manufacturing facility on the planet.

After the fall of the Star League, Kathil became a Federated Suns world and despite repeated attempts by the Capellan Confederation to either capture or damage the facilities on planet, it has remained a vital part of the Federation’s military and industrial strength.

The planet has three major continents and is otherwise covered in oceans. Muran is the largest continent and the most heavily populated and the home of District City, the capital, and most of the planet’s industry. Muran has varied terrain and climate, from the large mountain ranges in the west that are almost constantly under cloud cover and rain to the arid regions just beyond the mountains and temperate regions to the south and east. The continent of Hurste is the breadbasket of Kathil. However, agriculture is difficult on Kathil due to the native plant life and wide expanses of arid land that can only be farmed with significant irrigation efforts. The final continent of Thespia is the smallest and least hospitable. The continent is primarily arid and covered in rough mountains and dry deserts. Thespia does support several mining efforts that are used in the industry on Muran, however the climate and terrain make it difficult.

Over the centuries since the fall of the Star League the most important facilities have been the orbital shipyards which are capable of repairing, maintaining and building dropships and jumpships for the Federated Suns. By the end of the 3rd Succession War these facilities were one of only a small handful that remained in the entire Inner Sphere still capable of producing new jumpships.
