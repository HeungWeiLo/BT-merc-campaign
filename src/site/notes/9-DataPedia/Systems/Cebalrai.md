Less than hospitable, even before the arrival of human colonists, Cebalrai was settled more as a waystation than as a home to millions of people. With a thin atmosphere and a flimsy ozone layer, this world is continuously doused by far too much solar radiation from its giant K2 star, and so the first colonists to this world—and all their descendants since—erected partially reflective domes and screens over their structures and smaller communities.

During the Age of War that preceded the rise of the Star League, renegade forces hit Cebalrai from a neighboring system and employed nuclear weapons against the capital city of Wade to cover their escape. Extensive efforts to cure the planet‘s ills, both natural and manmade, were undertaken with aid from Star League engineers during the height of humanity‘s Golden Age, restoring and purifying much of Cebalrai‘s air and water. Remarkably, even the hellish warfare that raged after the fall of the League did not visit this world with the same punishment as the Age of War, though continuing border clashes between Houses Steiner and Kurita frequently left the rocky landscape and delicate woodlands scarred by conventional weaponry. In fact, despite the centuries of continuous conflict, the people of Cebalrai actually managed to thrive until the Word of Blake launched its Jihad against the Inner Sphere. This world fell easily to the fanatics and their allied mercenaries in a lightning blitzkrieg, and when Clan Ghost Bear arrived to reclaim the planet, they found their enemy entrenched in the major cities on the three populated landmasses of Dragga, Sarrina, and Lennori. Outnumbered and outclassed, the Blakists and their mercenaries were almost effortlessly ejected from each city, until their final stand at Kamrin, located on the northwest shores of the southern Dragga continent. Backed to the wall, with their mercenary troops routed and any hope of victory lost, the Blakists set off a series of neutron bombs hidden throughout the industrial metropolis, wiping out the Ghost Bear liberators and themselves in the bargain.

As of the 32nd century, a monument to the Bears stands in the center of Kamrin that the locals believe is haunted by the spirits of the fallen Clansmen. According to local lore, the rearing obsidian bear can actually be heard roaring in the dead of night, crying out in rage at the glory snatched away at the very moment of triumph. Critics of such folklore, however, point out that the high concentration of Nova Cat Clansmen, resettled to Cebalrai during the formation of The Republic, explains the true origin of this local legend.

Cebalrai‘s capital city, New Wade, is located on the north polar continent of Sarrina, and is also home to the planet‘s single major spaceport. Lennori, the planet‘s other northern continent, is only habitable into its middle latitudes, as temperatures and other solar radiation hazards closer to the equatorial zones have rendered the southern reaches and the nearby equatorial continent of Hellesdon barren desert wastes.
