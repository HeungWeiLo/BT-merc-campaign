In the early days of space colonization, New Samarkand was one of the most populous colonies. It was also a deeply divided state. The planet was covered with sovereign city states that each had their own armed forces and were regularly at war with each other. It was on New Samarkand that House Kurita first rose to prominence, the brothers Shiro and Urizen Kurita rose first to control the city-state of Yamashiro and eventually the entire planet. From there they began the foundations for what would become the Draconis Combine.

New Samarkand served as the capital of the Draconis combine until June of 2617 when the Coordinator announced plans to move the capital to Luthien. New Samarkand's glory days vanished with the relocation of the Combine capital and many of its industrial concerns and it became a shadow of its former self.

During the Star League, New Samarkand hosted a major Star League military base and supply depot The planet was used as a major gathering point for the Star League Defense Force in preparation Exodus in 2784.

By the 31st Century, New Samarkand was covered by decaying cities that were once bustling and the hulks of long closed industries. However, the planet still boasts the Internal Security College, the Sun Zhang MechWarrior Academy and a handful of major factory complexes that are still active.

During the Jihad, Kiyomori Minamoto temporarily relocated the capital back to New Samarkand while Luthien was fought over by forces loyal to the Combine, Word of Blake and the Black Dragon Society. In addition to relocating the Combine's capital to New Samarkand the planet also became the head of the former Galdeon Military District after biological agents destroyed Galedon V. The return to prominence of New Samarkand has revitalized the economy on planet and attracted several more manufacturing concerns driven off their home planets by the Jihad.
