3135 - Poznan was colonized by refugees from Poland, Portugal, and Spain during the original Exodus from Terra. It was named after the first capital of the former Terran country of Poland. The continents of Boleslaw and Mieszko, located in the northern hemisphere, were settled by the Poles because the continents resembled their former homeland. Both continents produce iron ore, petroleum, and various agricultural products. Boleslaw is larger and more mountainous. Mieszko has more flatlands and rolling hills, and Lake Lednica, the largest freshwater lake on Poznan.

The Spanish were the largest group of settlers, claiming the four largest continents, Barcelona, Palma, Seville, and Zaragoza, located mostly in the equatorial zone. They established the planetary capital of New Madrid on Barcelona, the largest of the four continents. Here they thrived and traded with their neighbors in the north and south. The Portuguese settled on the island continent of Galicia which is rich in minerals, precious metals, and titanium ore.

During the next two centuries, Poznan flourished. However an ugly and brutal civil war was fought between the Poles and Spaniards over Palma. The Spaniards won and a planetary government was formed. In 2320, Poznan was offered membership into the Duchy of Liao. Over the next three hundred years, Poznan‘s population increased tenfold, with many of Chinese descent immigrating until the Spaniards were in the minority.

During the Fourth Succession War, Federated Suns forces captured Poznan and they helped relieve the oppression caused by the Chinese population and installed a new government. When the Capellan Confederation regained control, the Chancellor decreed that nothing would change and left the new leadership in place. This act did more to win the hearts of the people than anything else. This was apparent when the Republic of the Sphere laid claim to Poznan, it has continued to harbor dissidents and malcontents.
