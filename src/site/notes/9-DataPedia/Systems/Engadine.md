Engadine was originally settled by the Rim Worlds Republic as an exile colony for political dissidents and non-violent criminals that Republic’s government did not want mixing with the rest of the nation’s populace. Engadine is a cool planet and large portions of it spend all year covered in ice, with near-constant light snowfall. The harsh temperatures hardened the original exiles/colonists into rough survivalists. The planet only became slightly more settled several decades later, after a routine inspection by a Rim Worlds Republic official decided the planet was a paradise and built a large personal compound, which later expanded into a popular resort.

The fighting on Engadine was short-lived during Operation: MAILED FIST, because the oppressed population were more than willing to feed information to the Lyrans about the locations and movements of the Rim Worlds forces that attempted to conduct hit and fade tactics that were successful on most planets. Unfortunately, after the Reunification War ended, the planet returned to Republic hands and many of the families responsible for assisting the Lyrans were persecuted.

After the fall of Amaris, Engadine was one of the first non-industrial worlds captured by the Lyrans and their work to improve the planet’s poor infrastructure, including asking ComStar to build an HPG on the planet, helped win over the long oppressed populace.
