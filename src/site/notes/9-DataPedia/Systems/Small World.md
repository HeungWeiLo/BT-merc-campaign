Having only entered its current ice age about a thousand years ago, Small World is a cold world, where icebergs float endlessly across over two-thirds of the planet‘s surface, and where three of its five continents lie under expanding polar glaciers. The earliest expeditions to this world aimed at establishing settlements on the few habitable regions of the planet‘s two small equatorial continents of Gladstone and Motherland, when geologists discovered that a wealth of raw radioactive elements lay just below the surface. The Small family, after which the world was named, quickly capitalized on this discovery and established Small World as a port of call for industries in need of radioactive raw materials. Most of Small World‘s business, even today, comes from the mining, refining, and sale of radioactives and other minerals mined below its frozen lands, though only five major cities exist on the equatorial continents. In 3058, the Small family‘s dream to forge an empire was briefly realized after the breakup of the Federated Commonwealth, when the Duke of Small tried to seize several nearby worlds in a political and military campaign. These efforts broke down again just a few, short years later, and led to the collapse of the Small family and its fall from power. Aside from the cities on Gladstone and Motherland—including the planetary capital and port city of New Mariotta—small mining settlements exist on the northern continent of Everfrost, and the southern continents of Killingly and Hollonna.
