3135 - Palos is a large world, measuring nearly 15,000 kilometers at the equator. Palos was colonized in the early 23rd century and quickly became a major source of important ores and minerals. Its three continents, Cartagena, Murcia, and Valencia, cover just over 40 percent of the planet's surface. Valencia, is the largest of the three, is covered with vast woodlands and mountains. Xer, the capital city, is located on the northeastern coast, on the Iberian Peninsula.  Two hundred kilometers south of Xer is the barren Docarshon Valley. Early colonists discovered rich gold deposits in Docarson Valley that played out after three centuries of mining and it is now just an ugly scar of uncontrolled exploitation. Murcia is mostly mountains and valleys covered in sparse vegetation and timber. It is the home of the planet's massive mining operations. Careful land management has allowed Murcia to continue to produce a steady supply of ore and minerals. Cartagena is the smallest of the three continents and it supplies most of the planet's food, including domesticated indigenous mammals as an alternative to beef.

Palos has always been a planet of independent-minded people who believe in individual freedom and are always opposed to heavy taxes. In early 2305, Palos and Wei both rebelled against the Sarna Supremacy after years of heavy-handed taxation and economic exploitation. They declared their independence causing the Capellan-Supremacy War when the Capella Hegemony intervened to help both worlds.

During the Fourth Succession War, Federated Suns forces landed and were immediately met by the planet's inhabitants, who showed no fear in protesting their presence. After the planet fell, the people quietly chafed under Federated Commonwealth rule until the war of 3057 that shattered the Sarna March. Palos happily returned to the Capellan Confederation. Palos nearly revolted when Devlin Stone demanded the planet be included in The Republic of the Sphere.
