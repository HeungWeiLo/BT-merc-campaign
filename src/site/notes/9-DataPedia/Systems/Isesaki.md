Isesaki is a single world that orbits a close binary star system. The system was surveyed in 2281 and deemed of little value to the nascent Draconis Combine until the first colony was settled in 2612.

The planet’s surface is primarily water, although the oceans are heavily contaminated by poisonous bacteria and alkaline components and the five moons caused extreme tide fluctuations and limited coastal construction. Most of the planet’s drinkable water comes from difficult to access underground springs. Despite the difficulties, Isesaki is a beautiful ocean world, dotted with verdant forest islands and atolls and stunning views of the binary suns and five moons.

The planet was settled by Isesaki Shipping and within 200 years the corporation had built two JumpShip yards and several microgravity manufacturing facilities in orbit. Additionally an entire island had been converted into a small spacecraft manufacturing complex. As a result, the system became a major transportation hub for Combine traffic crossing the Draconis Rift and Isesaki Shipping became one of the largest commercial corporations in the realm.

The planet’s population almost entirely resides on the continent of Uchio, while the smaller continents of Isoroku and Matsubushi have remained unsettled and are utilized as peaceful, wilderness retreats for Isesaki employees. Both smaller continents are located along the equator and are covered in rich forests, rolling hills, and are home to sparkling springs. The only settlement on the smaller continents are a small lodges, built to belnd into the natural beauty of the area.

The Uchio continent is home to Toyohiro Akiyama Spacecraft Complex and the capital city of Ukonsoi, located on the central plains. The city’s architecture blends Rasalhagian, Shōwa, Buddhist, and neo-Qing design elements and the city center is dominated by the four towers of the Isesaki Shipping headquarters. The eastern end of the city is dominated by rows of massive warehouses, which hold products and shipments from across the Inner Sphere under heavy security. These bulk supplies are sorted and stored by Isesaki for futher shipment and transported around by the Roku Royal trains.

There are several other Combine or corporate interests on planet, which dot the rest of the continent’s surface and each is surrounded by residential and commercial districts in concentric patterns. At night, the lights from these cities give the impression of perfectly placed scales.
