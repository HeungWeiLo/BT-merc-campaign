Nirasaki was settled by communal idealists who hoped to create a perfect society, in which everyone would live in harmony in the virtual absence of government or a policing force. The experiment was only partially successful, as infighting between settlers and the early colonists' insistence on barter-based trade made it difficult to deal with other worlds for needed goods. Eventually, a basic planetary government, structured as a loose coalition of the various communes on Kalifax and Ouanii, Nirasaki‘s two largest continents, was established. Based on democratic principles, the Nirasaki government required a simple majority vote for any decisions affecting a planetary region or interplanetary relations and helped create a basic planetary economy based on work credits and a standard for determining the relative values of products and services. Beyond these basic functions, which included an emergency powers clause in case of an external threat, the Nirasaki government had no other authority. Farms, cattle ranches, fishing communities and artistic communes made up the bulk of Nirasaki‘s population until the rise of the Star League. Though Nirasaki was left to its semi-anarchistic government under the Hegemony, the planet began to draw the attention of entrepreneurs. However, few corporate entities could make headway on Nirasaki, due to lax government practices and the work credits system, until the native Nirasaki Computers Collective was founded in the large Blue Heron Commune. The NCC developed computer systems of astonishing efficiency and quality, including the famous Blue Lotus personal computer line, which was cutting edge in the Star League's day. For this reason, the Hegemony contracted the NCC to develop software for use in the Space Defense Systems throughout its holdings. As it happened, the NCC did its job too well in this regard. When the Amaris coup took place, the brightest minds of the Collective were forcibly relocated to Terra, and their work pitted the liberating SLDF forces against SDS networks that used some of the most sophisticated pseudo-artificial intelligence ever produced. It wasn‘t until years later, when returning SLDF forces uncovered technical specs hidden away for their benefit in the abandoned NCC headquarters, that their artful programming was defeated and the worlds Amaris had turned into deadly gauntlets were retaken. Though the NCC itself never revived after the fall of the League, its former offices and production facilities were eventually taken over by Blue Heron Computers, today a major producer of the Blue Lotus portable compads and noteputers used throughout the Inner Sphere. Nirasaki's government is more utilitarian now, a result of centuries under the Dragon‘s rule. It includes a planetary police force and a local militia, both based in the capital city of Elusian on the Kalifax continent. The Blue Heron Commune, one of the many cities that still hold to the traditions of communal existence, is located on the southern peninsula of Ouanii. Nirasaki‘s third major landmass, Arkatis, is in the planet‘s south polar region and is home to the Nirasaki Communications Community, a planetwide information and entertainment company based in the city of Arkatis' Unity.
