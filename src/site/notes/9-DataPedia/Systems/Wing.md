The high temperatures and high atmospheric pressures at sea level prompted many of the early settlers who came to Wing to establish their cities and colonies on the planet‘s rocky mountains and high plateaus. Many of these colonists also found these locales somewhat easier for maintaining steady communications with the mining outposts built on all four of the world‘s moons, all of which are heavily laced with valuable ores, including titanium, bauxite, and even germanium. It was the moons of Wing that truly drew the crowds to this world, rather than the inhabitability of the planet below, but the discovery of a world capable of supporting life was seen as a definite plus to the corporations that funded the first expeditions here. This resource-rich system was quickly incorporated into the Free Worlds League before the expanding Federation of Skye could stake a claim here, but with the rise of the Terran Hegemony and the Free Worlds‘ admission into the original Star League, this world became a joint holding between Houses Marik and Cameron. Wing‘s industry made it a border trading post and relay station for Hegemony and Free Worlds traffic alike. After the fall of the Star League, Wing reverted to complete Free Worlds authority, only to be captured by House Steiner‘s Lyran Commonwealth during an early offensive. The Free Worlds League reclaimed Wing in 2917, but in the centuries of the Succession Wars, constant raids and the changing of hands eventually took their toll on this planet. By the mid-thirty-first century, over half the planet‘s Star League-era settlements and mining outposts on all four moons were lost forever, decimating the planetary economy and seriously impairing off-world trade. The worst, however, came during the Jihad, when renegade Marik troops, duped by the Word of Blake, launched an ill-fated assault on the Lyran Alliance‘s Skye region. The assaults and counter assaults that followed slammed through Wing and over several other border worlds, devastating military and civilian targets alike. Although the world was returned to Free Worlds authority—more accurately, the authority of the Marik-Stewart Commonwealth—it was so ravaged by the fighting during the Jihad that the planet was willingly ceded, along with several others, to Devlin Stone‘s Republic of the Sphere. Under Republic control, much has been done for the world‘s recovery, with several relocated mining conglomerates eagerly investing in the restoration of facilities on the moons of Wing. The recovery has also added a surge of new residents and citizens who have rebuilt and expanded several of the planet‘s more prominent cities. A new movement to exploit the resources of Wing itself is also underway, thanks to the recent discovery of crude oil deposits in some of the lowland regions on the northern Glyph continent. The planetary capital of Wing, Crow‘s Nest, is located on the southern continent of Sharr. Crow‘s Nest also includes a large spaceport, but not the planet‘s largest one. That honor goes to Port Wyvern, the massive DropShip landing and servicing complex on the south polar continent of Greinwald, around which the city of Wyvern has grown.
