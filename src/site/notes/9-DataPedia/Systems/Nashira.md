Valuable minerals, chemical wealth, and advanced electronics, metallurgical and hydrocarbon fuel industries—coupled with a pleasant terrestrial climate—made Nashira a valuable world to both the Draconis Combine and the Terran Hegemony. Rather than fighting over it, however, the Camerons and Kuritas reached a compromise in which the planet would be jointly administered, with the planet‘s exports divided evenly between their governments. This ―shared world‖ status made Nashira a cosmopolitan planet, with diverse Hegemony cities standing side by side with those of the heavily Japanese-influenced Combine. Of course, the simmering hostilities that tended to flare up between Combine and Hegemony citizens were worse on Nashira than on many other planets. The worst of these incidents occurred during the so-called Hidden War, when outraged Kuritans, furious over the outcome of an epic clash on Solaris VII between SLDF Gunslinger Daniel Allison and a so-called ronin named Kaneda Fujima, rioted in the capital of Logan City. The Hegemony city, forced to call in troops to quell the violence, requested the aid of both SLDF and DCMS troops on world, as was protocol during such disturbances. Unfortunately, in a few instances the troops found themselves drawn into the conflict, with SLDF units firing upon Combine troops and vice versa. More than two thousand lives were lost in the three bloody days of the Logan Riots, a black stain on the honor of both states. After the fall of the Star League, Nashira became a Combine holding, which made use of the local industries and valuable minerals to strengthen its military machine and its economic might. The Combine launched an extensive campaign to transform the planet into a fully Japanese culture, including the demolition, renovation and renaming of many Hegemony cities and towns. Residents who clung to non-Japanese cultures and ideologies were persecuted and segregated, but true atrocities were rare. For this reason, Nashira remains a diverse world, made more so by Devlin Stone‘s relocation programs after the Jihad. Logan City, on the northern continent of Katiasha, is still the planetary capital, with a population of almost five million. Ogawa, a city still thick with Combine influence, lies fifty kilometers south of Logan City and is the planet‘s major spaceport as well as home to a third of the planetary defense forces. On Nashira‘s southern continent of Copenwald are found the majority of the planet‘s mining and manufacturing industries, including DeValt Industries, a minor manufacturer of MinerMechs and ConstructionMechs, based in the city of New Anaheim.
