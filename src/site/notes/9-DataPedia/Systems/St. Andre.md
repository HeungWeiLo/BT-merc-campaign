3135 - Most of St. Andre's two continents are covered in red desert. The northern continent of Ravensglade is flat and featureless. Ravensglade is cold and frozen for six months of the year because it is located above the arctic circle. Only a small portion of St. Andre's population lives on Ravensglade, its industries produces petroleum and coal, as well as a small amount of uranium. The Star League built a base on Ravensglade to protect the planet. Most of St. Andre's population resides on Georama which is larger and more hospitable than Ravensglade. It is situated in the southern and equatorial regions, with a hot desert environment. Jerome, the capital of St. Andre is located on Georama.

St. Andre was at the forefront of interstellar politics from the time when it was colonised. St. Andre's prestige comes from its early days, when Capella and the Sarna Supremacy were at war. In 2305, elite troops from St. Andre were used to aid the worlds Palos and Wei. In July 2366, the leaders of the Sarna Supremacy, the Tikonov Grand Union, the Liao Protectorate, the Sian, and the St. Ives governments met on St. Andre, voted and formed the Capellan Confederation.

In 3007, the Federated Suns sent the Dragoons to raid the megafactory of Seluk Electronics Ltd. During the Fourth Succession War, Federated Suns forces invaded again and captured the planet. When the Federated Commonwealth split, the Capellan banner flew over St. Andre once again.

During the Jihad, St. Andre was attacked on three different occasions by Word of Blake forces. The Blakists were after the Star League base that had been renovated and put to good use by the CCAF. The first two attacked used conventional methods. The third attempt involved the use of chemical weapons. The prevailing trade winds blew the deadly gas back in the faces of the attackers, decimating their ranks. When The Republic of the Sphere claimed St. Andre, the planet resisted.
