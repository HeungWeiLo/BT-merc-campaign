3135 - Chertan is a water-poor world, blasted by a hot, white star. However, abundant mineral and metallurgical resources supported the founding of several settlements based around mining, refining, and manufacturing operations, despite the lack of arable land. The growth of nearby agricultural worlds and trade saw Chertan prosper from its export of raw materials and heavy machinery, and continued to do so until after the fall of the Star League. Theleopolis, the planetary capital and primary spaceport of Chertan, is located in the southern hemisphere just south of the Huron Sea. New Pittsburgh is located near the Eerie Sea, the northernmost of Chertan‘s three large bodies of water. Altonia, the third largest city after Theleopolis and New Pittsburgh, is located near the eastern edge of the Ontario Sea. Altonia is home to Artista Chemicals, Chertan‘s largest mineral mining and refining operation.

During the Succession Wars, Chertan was part of the Marik Principality of the Free World League. It was the target of many Lyran Commonwealth attacks. The invasions and raids disrupted off-world trade and decimated the few farms the planet could support and many of the industrial centres, leading to several food riots, one of which led to the dismissal of the planetary viscount in 2820.

During the Jihad, mercenaries employed by the Word of Blake savaged several mining towns and obliterated the spaceport at New Pittsburgh. Despite the damage, the planetary infrastructure and economy recovered following the influx of new residents relocated to Chertan under Devlin Stone‘s Relocation Act.
