3135 - The first colonists to Fomalhaut saw a world blessed with an unlimited water supply and lush semi-tropical forestlands. Only a pair of small landmasses—Oanhu in the southern hemisphere, and Lyria in the equatorial zone—and a few dozen islands rise from the Endless Seas, Fomalhaut‘s planet-wide ocean. Settlers, most descended from the Hawaiian and Filipino cultures of Terra, readily took to this planet, and established themselves on every landmass that could support life before too long. Exploiting the natural beauty, unique three-moon nightscape, and infinite emerald seas, these settlers made Fomalhaut into a resort world. Larger industries failed to take root on the planet, though an orbital ore-refining station was established to take advantage of the metals found on the volcanic inner moon of Scarlet. By the time of the Star League, very little had changed on Fomalhaut, and the planet was a favorite getaway for the Terran Hegemony‘s idle rich. The lack of heavy industry spared the world much of the damage inflicted by Amaris forces during the final days of the Star League, save for the destruction of the Scarlet refining station and the planetary spaceport of Otaku. Thus, when the Federated Suns and later the Draconis Combine claimed the world after the League‘s fall, they too benefited from the tranquil beauty of this ocean world, though the centuries of near-constant warfare led to the planet being raided by hostile troops on more than one occasion. During the Jihad, however, Blakist forces were not as impressed with the eternal splendor of Fomalhaut. As a hostile border world, just one jump from Terra, the planet was assaulted and occupied in a lightning strike by mercenaries, in the Word of Blake‘s employ, who had to be rooted out of the planet‘s cities by Combine troops during the campaign to end the Jihad. Many of the world‘s most beautiful resort towns were reduced to rubble in the fighting, and the capital city, Lollanda, on Oanhu, had to be completely rebuilt after the Blakist mercenaries set it ablaze to distract the liberating forces.
