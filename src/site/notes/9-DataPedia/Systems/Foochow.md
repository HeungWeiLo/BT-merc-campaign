3135 - Foochow is named after the capital of the Fujian province in southeast China. It was discovered almost by accident and colonized in the late 22nd century by a sizeable population escaping from China on Terra. Min-how, the only continent, is located along the equator and was mostly jungle when the colonists first landed. They spent the first 50 years fighting disease-carrying insects and large six-limbed carnivores the size of black bears called Dobars. The settlers overcame the land and were able to make it productive, even taming some of the Dobars.

Foochow became a seafood exporter to many worlds. The planetary capital, Vashura, located on eastern Min-how, is the largest seaport and produces the bulk of the planet‘s exports in fish. Foochow had very little industry until the discovery of minerals used to produce electronics on Min-how‘s southwest coast. The town of Redswan is the Foochow‘s leading industrial city.

Foochow was not involved in the Jihad until one of the Warrior Houses jumped into the system. Soon after, Word of Blake employed a small mercenary force that entered the system and began a high-speed burn toward the planet. Hidden among the planet‘s moons, the Warrior House launched an aerospace assault that completely destroyed the attacking mercenaries.
