Orbiting a yellow giant that is prone to all manner of solar activity, from massive sunspots to occasional gravitational shifts intense enough to set off earthquakes and volcanoes, Vindemiatrix is a world facing its own eventual extinction. Scientists believe the final collapse of the parent star is still several thousand years away, but already the effects of its death throes have been felt on this world. In the centuries since the first settlers came here, over fifteen percent of the various species in the local flora and fauna have become extinct, with another thirty percent formally listed as endangered due to gradual changes in climate and the added stress of human occupation. Though numerous initiatives to slow the decline of the ecosystem have been attempted through the centuries, none have been entirely successful. Despite this gloomy forecast, Vindemiatrix remains a pleasant enough world to visit and live on. Several veins of common metals, suitable to support a modest industrial base, are backed up by enough arable land to support the planet‘s population. The planet is also home to the Vindemiatrix Observatory, a university focused almost exclusively on the study of planetology and stellar phenomena. Understandably, the largest focus of study at the Observatory campus is that of stellar life cycles, with the planet‘s own star serving as a point of reference. Vindemiatrix Observatory is located on the outskirts of Havannask, a mining town on the northern continent of Treshiria. The planetary capital, Brattleston Depot, and its attendant spaceport, are located on the southeastern continent of Scandavara. Vindemiatrix‘s third large landmass, the southwestern continent of Kressia, is home to most of the planet‘s ranching and farming communities, thanks to its abundance of arable land, and also boasts the largest natural wildlife preserves for the planet‘s endangered species.
